# PCA examples

I chose two recent papers published in Nature in which PCA was used.
Click on the tab corresponding to your group and follow the instructions.
Prepare a 5-slide presentation in which you will (quickly) explain the context,
and detail your progress when trying to reproduce the PCA-related figure.

*NB: It is not necessary to download the count matrix, unless you are curious about the difference between running the PCA on count data vs. pre-processed data*

## Group 1

The paper from which your figure was extracted is 

> Bosch, M., Kallin, N., Donakonda, S. et al. A liver immune rheostat regulates CD8 T cell immunity in chronic HBV infection. Nature 631, 867–875 (2024). [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07630-7](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07630-7)

  1. Read the paper.
  2. Download the pre-processed data that I created from the public data-set [GSE168096](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE168096).
  3. Explore quickly this data-set. Try to imagine, from indications given in 
  the paper, the steps that were required to go from the count matrix to this file.
  4. Reproduce Figure 1-h.

## Group 2

The paper from which your figure was extracted is 

> Ruetz, T.J., Pogson, A.N., Kashiwagi, C.M. et al. CRISPR–Cas9 screens reveal regulators of ageing in neural stem cells. Nature 634, 1150–1159 (2024). [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07972-2](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07972-2)

  1. Read the paper.
  2. Download the pre-processed data that I created from the public data-set [GSE189251](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE189251).
  3. Explore quickly this data-set. Try to imagine, from indications given in 
  the paper, the steps that were required to go from the count matrix to this file.
  4. Reproduce Supplementary Figure 1-d.
